 Command-line frontend to the internetarchive Python library.

I've wanted something to work on so instead of beeing lazy and finding a frontend that was already created I enbarked on a journey to make a frontend my self, and hopefully learn something along the way. If you need a professional tool this is probably not for you.
## Note
This tool isn't in it's final state yet. Infact, there's a long way til it will be as good as I want it to be.
# Features
* Downloading of The Internet Archive items. If you need to enable or disable a specific function you must do it manually because I haven't yet inplemented function switches and for example format selection.
* Searching for items on The Internet Archive. In the future I will inplement choice of item to download, but for now it's just a basic search function.

# Contributing
Feel free to throw pull requests my way. I'm still a beginnr at Python so feel free to simplify what can be simplified, and correct what needs correction, maybe even add a feature or 2.
